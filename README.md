# Endogenous-Radiolytic-Production-of-Oxygen-and-Its-Potential-to-Support-Habitable-Environments-in-Ocean-Worlds

This repository includes the report and slide from the group project I completed with two other students at USTH.

**Objective**: Investigate the in-situ production of molecular oxygen and hydrogen in Europa’s subsurface ocean through gamma emission of radioactive potassium decay.

**Method**: Calculate the production of radiolysis products based on 4 different extraction factor models.

**Comparison**: Compare modeled results to sublethal oxygen thresholds of Earth’s aquatic organisms and observed data on Europa's ice surface by NASA's Juno mission.

**Language**: Python.
